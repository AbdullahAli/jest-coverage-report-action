This action uses [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) to extract code coverage, and comments it on pull request. Inspired by [Size-limit action](https://github.com/andresz1/size-limit-action/). Features:

-   **Commenting** pull request with current code coverage.
-   **Comparing** coverage with base branch.
-   Showing spoiler in the comment for all **new covered files**.
-   Showing spoiler in the comment for all files, in which **coverage was reduced**.

## Usage

1. Install and configure [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
2. Create new action inside `.github/workflows`:

```yml
name: 'coverage'
on:
    pull_request:
        branches:
            - master
jobs:
    coverage:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        env:
            CI_JOB_NUMBER: 1
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v1
            - uses: artiomtr/jest-coverage-report-action@v1
              with:
                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

3. That's it!

## Customizing test script

By default, this action will run this command, to extract coverage:

```bash
npx jest --silent --coverage --coverageReporters="text" --coverageReporters="text-summary"
```

If you're not satisfied with default behaviour, you can specify your own command, by passing custom option `test_script`

For instance, if you want to run `test:coverage` npm script:

```yml
with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    test_script: npm run test:coverage
```
